## Templates
The templates can be completely overridden and some of them are:

- `list_template`: Template to use for list page. Default is fastdaisy_admin/list.html.
- `create_template`: Template to use for creation page. Default is fastdaisy_admin/create.html.
- `edit_template`: Template to use for edit page. Default is fastdaisy_admin/edit.html.

```python
class UserAdmin(ModelView):
    model = User
    list_template = "custom_list.html"

```

## Events
There are four methods that you can use to do some actions before or after a model was created, updated or deleted.
- `on_model_change`: Called before a model was created or updated.
- `after_model_change`: Called after a model was created or updated.
- `on_model_delete`: Called before a model was deleted.
- `after_model_delete`: Called after a model was deleted.

```python

class UserAdmin(ModelView):
    model = User
    async def on_model_change(self, data, model, is_created, request):
        # Perform some other action
        ...

    async def on_model_delete(self, model, request):
        # Perform some other action
        ...

```

## Custom Action

The available options for action are:

- `name`: A string name to be used in URL for this action.
- `label`: A string for describing this action.
- `add_in_list`: A boolean indicating if this action should be available in list page.
- `add_in_detail`: A boolean indicating if this action should be available in detail page.
- `confirmation_message`: A string message that if defined, will open a modal to ask for confirmation before calling the action method.

```python

from fastdaisy_admin import BaseView, action

class UserAdmin(ModelView):
    model = User
    @action(
        name="approve_users",
        label="Approve",
        confirmation_message="Are you sure?",
        add_in_detail=True,
        add_in_list=True,
    )
    async def approve_users(self, request: Request):
        pks = request.query_params.get("pks", "").split(",")
        if pks:
            for pk in pks:
                model: User = await self.get_object_for_edit(pk)
                ...

        referer = request.headers.get("Referer")
        if referer:
            return RedirectResponse(referer)
        else:
            return RedirectResponse(request.url_for("admin:list", identity=self.identity))

admin.add_view(UserAdmin)

```
