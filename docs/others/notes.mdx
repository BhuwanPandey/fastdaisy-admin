The goal of this project is to bring a `Django Admin` like experience to FastAPI applications. It still under 
active development, some features may be missing or behave differently compared to `Django Admin`.

At its core, this project is built on top of `sqladmin`, meaning most features available in `sqladmin` are also supported here.

### `fastdaisy_admin` vs `sqladmin`
- `fastdaisy_admin` is inspired by the look and feel of `Django Admin`.
- The `detail page` section has been removed.
- `Secret key` is required during the setup.
- Improvement
    - Simplified creation of custom actions
    - Filters can be applied without explicitly defining filter classes
    - Success messages are shown after creating or editing data
    - Confirmation page displays a list of items before deletion
    - Enhanced pagination
    - Fully styled using `DaisyUI`

<Warning>
Most features are not explicitly documented here, as they behave the same as in sqladmin. 
For more details, refer to the [sqladmin documentation](https://aminalaee.github.io/sqladmin/)
. This documentation will be expanded in the future as unique features are added.
